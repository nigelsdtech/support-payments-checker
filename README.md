# support-payments-checker

I receive an email once a month with details about payments for my shifts and calls.

This script will:
* Check all shifts mentioned in the email also exist in my calendar (and that there are no extras in either).
* (TODO) Check with Tenrox to see that any calls booked have been paid out.
